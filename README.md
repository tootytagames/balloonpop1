# balloonpop1
A hackish balloon pop game which probably has a few bugs.

To build for mobile platforms, head over to Phonegap.com and sign up.  Pull in the code from Github and build (an easy point and click process).  The Android and Win Mobile packages will build fine, download the packages and try them out on your mobile device.  Don't leave "Install from unverified sources" checked; select install from a source other than Google Play for this one time only, and the equivalent on Windows mobile.

The iOS build will fail because there's no signing cert/developer cert to build the ipk with.  Enroll in the Apple developer program to get one and upload into your Phonegap build to build for all three platforms at once.
